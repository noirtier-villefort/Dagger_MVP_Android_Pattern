## Explanation
### package mvp:
* **_BaseContract_** interface - basic interface for other Contracts. Here you write your basic methods for Views and Presenters.
*  **_BasePresenter_** class - need to be parent for other Presenters. Has basic logic, that you dont need to write in every Presenter, such as attachView(), init() or destroy().
### package di:
* **_AppComponent_** interface - used to tell Dagger about an object (Activity) that requires a dependency(Presenter in our case) to be injected. For that, you expose a function(inject()) that takes as a parameter the object that requests injection(MainActivity in our case).
* **_Application_** class - here we create and store instance of interface, that generates the graph and annotated with @Component, in variable for call inject() in activities.
* **_MainModule_** class - here we define dependencies that would be Injected.
